# Exercise 1: Write a function that, from a list of integers,
# determines the maximum number of consecutive occurrences strictly greater than 10.
# Provide two versions of this program, one with index handling and another without.

# Exercise 2: Write a function that, from a list of integers,
# determines the maximum difference between two consecutive values. Provide two versions of this program
# one with index handling and another without.

# Exercise 3: Write a function that, from a list of integers,
# shifts the elements of this list by one element to the right (circular shift,
# the last element then becomes the first)

# Exercise 4: Write a function that, from a list of integers,
# shifts the elements of this list by one element to the left (circular shift,
# the first element then becomes the last)

# Exercise 5: Write a function that, from a list of integers with a value x and an index i,
# inserts the value x at index i without using the insert() method.

# Exercise 6: Write a function that, from a list of integers,
# determines if the list is increasing. The function returns a boolean.

# Exercise 7: Write a function that, from a list of integers,
# determines the longest uninterrupted succession of values arranged in ascending order

# Exercise 8: Write a function that, from two ascending lists of any size,
# constructs an ascending list.

# Exercise 9: Write a function that constructs a list of 8 elements containing
# randomly the values from 1 to 8, each value must be unique.

# Exercise 10: Write a function that, from two lists of integers,
# determines the number of elements present in both lists. Provide two versions,
# one with the in operator and the other without.

# Exercise 11: Write a function that, from a matrix containing integers
# implemented by a list of lists, adds a last column containing the average of each row
# (be careful, sublists may have variable sizes)

# Exercise 12: Write a function that, from a matrix containing integers implemented
# by a list of lists, adds a last line containing the number of even values in each column.

# Exercise 13: Write a function that, from a 3x4 matrix implemented by a list of lists,
# constructs a list of 12 elements containing successively the elements of the matrix, row by row.

# Exercise 14: Write a function that, from a 3x4 matrix implemented by a list of lists,
# constructs a list of 12 elements containing successively the elements of the matrix, column by column.

# verifies that there is at least one row where all elements have the same value.

# Exercise 16: Write a function that, from a 3x3 matrix implemented by a list of lists,
# verifies that there is at least one column where all elements have the same value.

# Exercise 17: Write a function that, from a 3x3 matrix implemented by a list of lists,
# verifies that all elements have different values.

# Exercise 18: Write a function that, from a 3x3 matrix implemented by a list of lists,
# sets all elements of a row to 0 if the sum of these elements is a multiple of 5.

# Exercise 19: Write a function that, from a 3x3 matrix implemented by a list of lists,
# sets all elements of a column to 0 if the sum of these elements is a multiple of 5.

# Exercise 20: Write a function that, from a 3x5 matrix implemented by a list of lists,
# permutes the rows and columns to obtain a 5x3 matrix.
